    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is my family's Swedish pancakes recipe that has been passed down from my paternal great-great+ grandmother. It's simple, yet delicious!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup flour</li>
      <li>1 & 1/3 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>dash of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Add all ingredients except flour to blender.</li>
      <li>Blend for a few seconds until mixed.</li>
      <li>Slowly add flour to blender, mixing until it's incorporated, but ensuring not to mix for too long.</li>
      <li>Heat pan on medium heat and melt enough butter to lightly coat the pan.</li>
      <li>Add about a quarter cup of batter to the pan, and then tilt the pan in a circle so the batter spreads evenly.</li>
      <li>When the batter becomes opaque (not shiny) on top, use a spatula to gently lift the edges, and then flip the pancake.</li>
      <li>Cook for a short amount of time, until slightly browned, and then remove from the pan.</li>
      <li>Repeat with remaining batter, melting butter in the pan before each new pancake.</li>
      <li>Top with your favorite toppings! Some popular options are: maple syrup, powdered sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, lingonberries, or other berries!</li>
    </ol>
