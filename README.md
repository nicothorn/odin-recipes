# odin-recipes

Creating a simple recipe website as the final project for The Odin Project's Foundations introductory course.

This project will demonstrate extremely basic HTML and CSS knowledge. As I'm already very familiar with HTML and CSS, I'm using it more as a project to help develop good Git habits and practice writing good commit messages.
